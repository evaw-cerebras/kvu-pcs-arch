# **CONFIDENTIAL – FOR INTERNAL AUDIT USE ONLY**
:::

## Document Classification  
- **Classification Level**: Confidential  
- **Intended Audience**: Security, Compliance, and Infrastructure Teams  
- **Distribution**: Restricted  
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly or upon vendor change  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents the security assessment of proposed storage solutions from third-party vendors, evaluated in accordance with **Cerebras cluster deployment security requirements**. The assessment ensures adherence to principles of **due diligence** and **due care**, as mandated by organizational data protection policies and regulatory compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, NIST SP 800-53).

Key focus areas include:
- Data at rest, in transit, and management plane security
- Secure data disposition and media sanitization
- Vendor implementation of technical and organizational controls

> **Note**: This assessment supports risk mitigation and audit readiness under Cerebras’ Information Security Management System (ISMS).

## 2. Assessment Scope

The evaluation covers the following components of vendor-proposed storage ecosystems:

| Component | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Data at Rest** | Encryption, access controls, storage media lifecycle |
| **Data in Transit** | TLS usage, network segmentation, secure replication |
| **Management Plane** | Authentication, logging, API security, RBAC |
| **Data Disposition** | Sanitization methods, cryptographic erasure, physical destruction |
| **Compliance Alignment** | Support for audit logging, regulatory reporting, retention policies |

---

## 3. Vendor Evaluation Criteria

The following security controls were assessed for each vendor:

### 3.1. Technical Controls
- Encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3+ in transit)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access
- Immutable logging and tamper-evident audit trails
- Integration with SIEM and Cerebras ISE (Identity Services Engine)

### 3.2. Organizational Controls
- Vendor SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001 certification
- Incident response and breach notification timelines
- Personnel security and background checks
- Third-party audit availability

### 3.3. Data Lifecycle Management
- Secure provisioning and decommissioning
- **Data Sanitization**:
  - Software-based wiping (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M)
  - Cryptographic erasure with key destruction
  - Physical destruction certification (for retired media)

## 4. Findings and Observations

### Vendor A: NetStore Solutions Inc.
- ✅ Supports AES-256 encryption and TLS 1.3
- ⚠️ No cryptographic erasure API; manual key revocation required
- ❌ Audit logs not exportable in Splunk-compatible format

> **Risk Rating**: Medium  
> **Recommendation**: Conditional approval with remediation plan

### Vendor B: SecureArray Technologies
- ✅ Full integration with Cerebras ISE and Active Directory
- ✅ Automated sanitization workflow with audit trail
- ✅ Provides annual third-party penetration test reports

> **Risk Rating**: Low  
> **Recommendation**: Approved for deployment

---

## 5. Conclusion

Based on due diligence and due care principles, **SecureArray Technologies (Vendor B)** meets Cerebras’s security and compliance requirements for storage deployment. **NetStore Solutions (Vendor A)** requires remediation before approval.

All findings have been documented to ensure **audit traceability**, **regulatory compliance**, and alignment with **Cerebras’s data governance framework**.
