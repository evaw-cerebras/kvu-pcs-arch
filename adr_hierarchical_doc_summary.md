## Hierarchical Document Summary

### 1. System Architecture
- **Two-Tiered Design:** Memory + Low-latency, High-endurance disks
- **Data Movement:** Passive vs. Optimized automated systems
- **Data Retrieval:** Responsibility and mechanisms for returning data to memory

### 2. Namespace Management
- **Single Namespace:** Centralized tracking system
- **Namespace Scope:** Per model or per replica

### 3. Technology Choices
- **RDMA/NVMe-oF:**
  - Advantages: HW-assisted efficiency, remote memory handling
  - Disadvantages: Complexity and hardware requirements
- **Traditional Distributed Storage:**
  - Advantages: Simpler indexing, lower hardware complexity
  - Disadvantages: Possibly lower performance

### 4. Network Considerations
- **Topology:** Cost-effective and scalable designs
- **KVSS Placement:** Optimize network load management for SW pieces interfacing with CS-X

### 5. Cache Management and Queries
- **Cache Awareness:** Optimized SW-driver queries
- **Cache Miss Handling:** Strategies to minimize latency impact

### 6. System Interface
- **Interface Requirements:**
  - Load/store/query mechanisms
  - Cache priority and replacement logic
- **3rd Party Compatibility:** Alignment with existing industry standards and practices

### 7. Fault Tolerance
- **Disk Failures:** Defining impacted data
- **Machine Failures:** Ensuring system availability and performance despite data loss

### 8. System Evaluation and Decision
- **Existing Solutions:** Comparison with available systems (Redis, Mooncake)
- **Decision Factors:** Delta assessment, cost, and risks of adopting versus custom-building solutions
