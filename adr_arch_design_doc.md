# Architecture Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural decisions and design considerations for the caching and storage management system.

### System Objectives
- Optimize latency and performance through tiered caching.
- Ensure fault tolerance and high availability.
- Maintain interoperability with industry standards.

### Architecturally Significant Requirements
- Performance: Low-latency data retrieval and efficient cache management.
- Scalability: Scalable namespace management and network topology.
- Fault Tolerance: Defined recovery processes for disks and machines.

## Attribute-Driven Design Approach
- **Performance:** Tiered memory and disk caching, RDMA/NVMe-oF technology adoption.
- **Scalability:** Centralized namespace management, optimized network topology.
- **Interoperability:** Generalized, standardized interfaces.
- **Reliability:** Fault tolerance mechanisms for disk and machine failures.

## Definition of Done
- Clearly defined architectural decisions documented.
- Prototyped critical system components with performance analysis.
- Reviewed and accepted architecture by stakeholders.

## Definition of Ready
- Decisions clearly documented with context, consequences, and rationales.
- Stakeholder agreement on key architectural points.
- Feasibility and risks analyzed.

## Decision Management Tools
- Use standard ADR templates and decision-capturing tools to maintain documentation clarity and consistency.

## Next Steps
- Prototype and benchmark proposed design choices.
- Document and review performance and complexity trade-offs.
- Finalize pending decisions based on evaluation results.
